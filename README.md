# GM driven metabolic alterations in AD mice
The gut microbiota (GM) and its metabolites affect the host nervous system and are involved in the pathogeneses of various neurological diseases. However, the specific GM alterations under pathogenetic pressure and their contributions to the “microbiota–metabolite–brain axis” in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remain unclear. Here, we investigated the GM and the fecal, serum, cortical metabolomes in APP/PS1 and wild-type (WT) mice, revealing distinct hub bacteria in AD mice within scale-free GM networks shared by both groups. Here, we present the major bioinformatic scripts used in the study. <br>
* GM network construction
* Functional prediction with 16S sequences
* Correlations between GM and metabolites
* Mediation effect analysis
# Bioinformatic analysis
## GM network construction
Applying the sparCC software, we constructed the GM co-occurrence networks. The related files and scripts can be found under the  ```Network``` folder.<br>
